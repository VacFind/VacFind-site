## How can I help?

### As a user of the site:
If you found VacFind useful and want to support us, the most helpful thing you can do is to share a link our site on social media. This allows us to help more people find vaccines.

You can also join our [discord server]({{site.social.discord}}) or help us reach our funding goals on our [OpenCollective page][2].

### As a Developer:
We are on [github](https://github.com/{{site.github_username}})! Feel free to help us tackle open issues or join us on [discord]({{site.social.discord}}) to come chat with our community!

If you have a service like this for people already, get in contact with us at [{{site.contact.email}}][1]!
We are commited to bringing easy to access information such as where to get a vaccine to the general public.
Have some spare time on your hands?

### As a Hospital

If your hospital or other care provider would like to use VacFind to display your vaccine availability to end users, feel free to [email us][1] and we can help get your data integrated into our platform


## How do I submit a new link or correct an existing one?
We have a [form]({{site.data.link-corrections}}) for submitting updates and additions to our links

## Where do you get your data?
Our list of links is currently updated as we find new ones. Feel free to [send us more that you hear of]({{site.data.link-corrections}})!
<!-- Our vaccination site locations primarily come from  [mapping layers provided by GISCorps]({{site.data.map-source}}). We are also currently looking into other methods of collecting data.  -->


## Do you Accept Donations?

Yes but it is absolutely not necessary. Donations primarily allow us to offer higher quality and more reliable hosted services to other projects, such as our [AirTable caching API](https://docs.vacfind.org/Database/api)! You can support VacFind with a tax-deductible donation or see our finances on [our  OpenCollective page][2].
