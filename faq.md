## How can I help?

### As a user of the site:
If you found VacFind useful and want to support us, the most helpful thing you can do is to share a link our site on social media and help us spread the word. This allows us to help more people find vaccines.

You can find links to automatically draft posts for many popular social media sites [at the bottom of our homepage]({% link index.html %}#share-this-site )

You can also join our [discord server]({{site.social.discord}}) or help us reach our funding goals on our [OpenCollective page][2].

### As a Developer:
If you maintain a service that we link to, a simple link back to our site allows your users to easily find related resources to help them get vaccinated faster. Even a simple linkback can help us be seen by more search engines and help more people find the information they need 

We are also on [github](https://github.com/{{site.social.github_username}}) and willing to accept contributions to help improve our site or any of the other services we provide. Feel free to come chat with us on [discord]({{site.social.discord}}) if you'd like to learn more!


## How do I submit a new link or correct an existing one?
We have a [form]({{site.links.corrections}}) for submitting updates and additions to our links

## Where do you get your data?
Our list of links is currently being updated as we find new resources that are helpful to people. While we do try to actively discover new services through places like social media (and others), we mainly rely on people letting us know about new links that arent currently on our site!
<!-- Our vaccination site locations primarily come from  [mapping layers provided by GISCorps]({{site.links.map-source}}). We are also currently looking into other methods of collecting data.  -->


## Do you Accept Donations?

Yes but it is absolutely not necessary. Donations primarily allow us to provide better support to other smaller projects and contribute more time to the VacFind site and our related tools. You can support VacFind with a tax-deductible donation or see our finances on [our  OpenCollective page][2]. 


## What information do you collect about visitors to the site.

VacFind collects no personal information about visitors to our site. We use the open-source analytics tool Matomo to collect anonymous information about aggregate traffic patterns, as well as some generic information like your device screen size and operating system. This helps us understand how visitors find and use our site and allows us to ensure our site is compatible with your device.

We take thorough measures to ensure that the information collection respects your privacy as much as possible. We only store a small portion of all IP addresses and we respect any DNT (Do Not Track) signals sent by your browser.
