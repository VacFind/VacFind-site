	<p>Hi! We’re VacFind! Our goal is to make COVID-19 vaccinations as easy and accessible as possible.</p>
	
	<p>Once we’re up and running, this site will let you search for your location anywhere in the US and tell you the locations of the nearest places in your area that have COVID vaccines available and whether or not you’re eligible.</p>
