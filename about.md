## Who we are

We are a small team of student volunteers based near Portland, OR. Our goal with VacFind is to create high-quality, open-source tools and resources to make information about COVID-19 Vaccines as easy and accessible for as many people as possible.


## What we do

We are working in collaboration with volunteers from other projects such as [https://findyourvaccine.org](https://findyourvaccine.org) to help build a national tool for finding available vaccines. 

Most of our current projects are listed on our [docs page](https://docs.vacfind.org), but you can also join us on [discord]({{site.social.discord}}) if you'd like to chat with us about ways you can help!

We also hope to provide some of our own tools and services, such as our [Airtable Caching API](https://docs.vacfind.org/Database/api), to help smaller projects grow and get themselves out there without worrying about how to setup the technical aspects of their projects.


## Our Contributors
We would also like to give credit the amazing people <!-- and organisations -->who have helped support us:

### Founding team

- [Sydney VonArx](https://github.com/Form-And-Function/)
- Preston Hager
- [Adrian Edwards](https://www.adriancedwards.com)
- Rudy Peralta

### Financial backers
Our [financial backers]({{site.social.opencollective}}#section-contributors) help support our work and allow us to offer hosted services to other projects, such as access to our [caching API](https://docs.vacfind.org/Database/api)! Contributing is not required, but it helps us offer a higher level of performance and stability for the projects that rely on our tools and services to help more people find vaccines.
