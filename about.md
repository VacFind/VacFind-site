## Who we are

We are a small team of student volunteers based near Portland, OR. Our goal with VacFind is to create high-quality, open-source tools and resources to make information about COVID-19 Vaccines as easy and accessible for as many people as possible.


## What we do

There are three main ways that we hope to be able to help:

1. Creating an open-source, national public resource to make it easy and accessible for anyone to get a COVID vaccine.
2. Gathering and listing open source projects, data sources, and other resources for volunteers and developers to bring to their own communities
3. Facilitating collaboration between volunteers so time, information, and resources can be used most effectively
