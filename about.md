## Who are we?

We are a small team of student volunteers based near Portland, OR. Our goal with VacFind is to create high-quality, open-source tools and resources to make information about COVID-19 Vaccines as easy and accessible for as many people as possible.


## What do we do?

There are three main ways that we hope to be able to help:

1. Creating a single list of links to all known COVID vaccination, testing, and information sources for all US States, counties, and territories so they can be easily found by those who need them
2. Creating open source tools and documentation to help volunteer groups start their own state or local vaccination tracking and informational web pages
3. Reaching out and maintaining relationships with the creators of other vaccine tracking tools to help facilitate the exchange of information between groups, so information and resources can be effectively shared
